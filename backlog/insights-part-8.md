# Insights – Part 8

## On Archiving and Structuring Knowledge

- Every useful idea deserves a "home." A good archive reduces mental load and increases system trust.
- Long files should be broken into parts early, not only to prevent truncation but to preserve thematic clarity.
- File naming matters: short, consistent, and descriptive naming (e.g., `insights-part-X`) enables faster access and indexing.

## On Managing Low-Effort High-Reward Sessions

- High-volume insight sessions (e.g., using Perplexity suggestions) are sustainable if:
  - They’re fast (low cognitive and physical effort)
  - They’re stored and searchable
  - They don’t delay active build tasks
- Low-effort insight gathering is only valuable when synthesis and application loops are strong.

## On Working Memory and Fragmentation

- A major productivity bottleneck arises when short-term ideas aren’t captured reliably.
- A simple system for logging (e.g., appending to a GitHub file) preserves insights and avoids repeated thoughts.
- The key: don't force immediate organization—just reliable capture and periodic clean-up.

## On Naming and Structure

- “Insights” is better than “Ideas” when what’s being recorded is observed, not invented.
- Use folder names to reduce redundancy in filenames (e.g., `backlog/insights-part-X.md`, not `backlog/insights-log-part-X.md`)
- Standardize naming conventions to scale across hundreds of files without mental overhead.

## Next Steps

- Once all parts are uploaded, create a `README.md` or index file linking all insights.
- Consider tagging each part with topics (e.g., #tools, #bottlenecks, #workflow).
- Eventually automate this tagging and indexing process.
