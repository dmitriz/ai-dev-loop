# Insights â€“ Part 4

## On Cognitive Relief through Parallel Modes

- Alternate focus modes boost output.
- Perplexity's flow: dynamic momentum, minimal strain.
- Intentional multitasking: cognitive recovery.

## On Tool Boundaries

- AI tools: limited orchestration (e.g., complex workflow transitions).
- Collaborative swarms: task-specific handoff is key.
- Architectural bottlenecks: chat posting, file context limits.

## On Streamlined Capture Systems

- Capture insights: use Google Keep for quick notes.
- Tagging/auto-sorting: increases downstream value.
- Manual capture: automate processing/synthesis later.

## On Archives as Cognitive Extensions

- Insight archives: searchable, linkable, modular.
- `/backlog`: infrastructure of thought.
- Brevity + clarity: faster retrieval.

## On Readiness to Invest Time

- Invest in setup to reduce future friction.
- Short-term detours: eliminate systemic inefficiencies.
- Dynamic cost-benefit analysis: now vs. scalable later.
