# Insights – Part 4

## On Cognitive Relief through Parallel Modes

- Alternate focus modes boost output.
- Perplexity's flow: dynamic momentum, minimal strain.
- Intentional multitasking: cognitive recovery.

## On Tool Boundaries

- AI tools: limited orchestration (e.g., complex workflow transitions).
- Collaborative swarms: task-specific handoff is key.
- Architectural bottlenecks: chat posting, file context limits.

## On Streamlined Capture Systems

- Capture insights: use Google Keep for quick notes.
- Tagging/auto-sorting: increases downstream value.
- Manual capture: automate processing/synthesis later.

## On Archives as Cognitive Extensions

- Insight archives function like external memory: they must be searchable, linkable, and modular.
- Folders like `/backlog` act as “infrastructure of thought”—they enable structured deferral rather than forgetfulness.
- Naming conventions and structure are key to long-term retrieval; brevity plus clarity is optimal.

## On Readiness to Invest Time

- Time spent on foundational setup pays off when it reduces future decision friction.
- There’s wisdom in accepting short-term detours if they eliminate systemic inefficiencies later.
- The cost-benefit analysis of “now vs. scalable later” must be dynamic, not dogmatic.
