# Insights – Part 10

## On Strategic Layering of Knowledge and Execution

- Not all insights need immediate execution—store, tag, and revisit when relevant.
- Create a clear divide between “execution backlog” and “insight archive.”
- Long-term systems thinking is a valid investment, especially when paired with automation.

## On Tools that Accelerate Throughput

- Favor tools with a low activation cost—fast start, minimal overhead, responsive feedback.
- Perplexity’s low-effort, high-yield model offers compounding returns when paired with your workflow.
- AI tools should feel like collaborators, not interfaces. Look for ones that reduce your cognitive burden.

## On Breaking the Ceiling of Manual Capacity

- Manual workflows don’t scale well—your agent network should gradually assume:
  - Insight extraction
  - Task prioritization
  - Delegation
  - Retrospective analysis
- The human role becomes more supervisory: reviewing, nudging, re-aligning.

## On Designing Agent Ecosystems

- Feedback agents should cross-validate and challenge each other.
- Learning loops between agents (e.g., critique + correction + re-test) are vital for compound productivity.
- Future: agents form autonomous project loops with minimal human prompting.

## On Naming and Structure

- Use a short, consistent naming convention (e.g., `insights-part-X.md`) to avoid truncation and ambiguity.
- Use the folder name (`backlog`) as the context wrapper—file names don’t need to repeat that.
