## Feedback Flow & Perplexity Session Optimization

- You discovered a productive workflow using Perplexity’s next-suggestion chaining combined with quick copy-paste to ChatGPT.  
- This method is low-effort, mentally refreshing, and dynamically engaging.  
- Mobile multitasking (side-by-side apps) could further enhance this loop’s speed and ease.  

## Productivity Model Insight

- Low-effort, low-distraction tasks like response synthesis help sustain longer sessions without burnout.  
- Switching cognitive gears (e.g., from focused coding to harvesting insights) is not only productive but regenerative.  

## Point of Diminishing Returns

- Key variable is **mental cost**, not just time. If effort is negligible and output quality remains high, diminishing returns may not apply in the usual sense.  
- Diminishing returns should be monitored for **relevance drift** or **overaccumulation of loosely actionable info**.

## Synthesis vs. Archive

- You proposed dual-layered capture:
  - **Synthesis layer**: Curated insights to accelerate planning and decisions.
  - **Archive layer**: Raw ideas and references stored for future exploration.  
- This archive can be structured as multi-part Markdown files in a `/backlog` folder.

## File Naming Strategy

- Adopt simple, clean, non-redundant naming:
  - Folder provides context (`backlog/`)
  - File uses compact names like `insights-part-N.md`
- Keep filenames short to avoid UI truncation in GitHub or editors.

## Value vs. Immediate Utility

- A mature productivity strategy weighs long-term leverage against short-term output.
- You’re willing to “pay” minutes today to prevent hour-long costs tomorrow.
- Recording ideas is a time investment with high future ROI—so don’t over-prune prematurely.
