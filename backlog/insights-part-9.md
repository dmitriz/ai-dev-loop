# Insights – Part 9

## On Tradeoffs Between Immediate Delivery and Long-Term Efficiency

- Not all MVP work should be rushed—investing time now to prevent long-term waste can be justified.
- Evaluate “cuts” based not only on speed—but also on how they affect future development velocity.
- Strategic delay (e.g., to archive insights, test tooling) can improve system throughput long-term.

## On Side Sessions and Cognitive Relief

- Interleaving focused coding with exploratory activities (like AI querying) can refresh mental energy.
- Structured “side loops” (e.g., feedback harvesting with Perplexity) can be productive breaks, not distractions.
- The trick is to contain them with clear boundaries: defining when to start, what to capture, how to archive collected insights, and determining when to stop.

## On Session Layering and Mental Context Switching

- Use mobile features like split-screen to reduce friction between parallel task threads.
- Context switching is less harmful when the task types are cognitively distinct (e.g., typing vs. reading).
- Efficiency comes from minimizing re-orientation time, not necessarily doing one thing only.

## On High-Frequency Capture and Loop Design

- Frequent insight capture should not require task switching—it should be as easy as typing into a notepad.
- Offload storage and tagging from the brain to the system.
- Keep the feedback → insight → implementation → outcome loop tight and traceable.

## Suggested Practices

- Introduce a “daily dropbox” file for raw insights, cleaned and sorted weekly.
- Tag and link insights to related backlog items or MVPs.
- Use scripts or AI to propose next actions from insights (auto-summarization, label suggestion).
