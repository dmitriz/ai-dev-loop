# Insights – Part 6

## On the Value of Capturing Everything

- Ideas are volatile—without a frictionless way to capture them, potential is lost before it's recognized.
- The cost of over-capturing is minimal compared to the cost of forgetting a breakthrough.
- A persistent archive (even unstructured) is better than trying to mentally juggle ephemeral insights.

## On Naming and File Structure

- Clean, minimal filenames help avoid cognitive friction during search and reuse (e.g., `meeting-notes.md` instead of `MeetingNotesFrom20240101.md`).
- Folder context (e.g., `/backlog`) should carry semantic weight so file names can stay concise.
- Sequential naming (`insights-part-X`) enables chronological anchoring and easy automation.

## On Minimizing Friction for Future Retrieval

- Consistent naming, format, and structure enable easier parsing by agents or scripts later.
- Human readability is still important—even if automation increases, the file must be quickly browsable.
- Meta-notes like `# Insights – Part X` act as anchors and afford fast scanning.

## On Strategic Use of “Backlog”

- The backlog is not a junk drawer; it's a reservoir of potential future value.
- Deferring is not discarding—deferral with tagging allows for prioritization without decision pressure.
- Backlog should be revisited regularly, but only with systems to surface timely and relevant content.

## On Time Efficiency as a Design Constraint

- Every improvement to reduce idea-to-record time compounds value across the system.
- Low-friction capture and delegation workflows allow humans to focus on higher-level synthesis.
- Managing insight logistics is a critical bottleneck reducer—process is productivity.
