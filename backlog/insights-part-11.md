# Insights – Part 11

## On Scaling Feedback Loops

- Create internal protocols for summarizing and storing responses from AI assistants.
- Systematically compare insights from multiple models (e.g., Gemini, Claude, Perplexity).
- Treat external feedback as inputs into your insight archive, not just transient chat content.

## On Information Archiving Strategy

- Every insight session should generate a persistent artifact (like a markdown file).
- Structure insights into digestible parts (parts 1–N) to prevent truncation or overload.
- Store in a version-controlled system (e.g., GitHub) for traceability, sharing, and automation.

## On Time Investment Tradeoffs

- A few minutes spent now on structured archiving may save hours of repeated analysis later.
- Long-term memory > short-term urgency in systems that accumulate insight over time.
- Prioritize workflows that compound in value with minimal recurring cost.

## On Flow Between Knowledge & Action

- Treat the insight archive as a launching pad for MVP decisions.
- Keep a “reviewable backlog” of insights when prioritizing new features or iterations.
- Don’t let unstructured brilliance get lost—routine review builds strategic clarity.
