# Reviewer Interaction Assistant

## Purpose

The **Reviewer Interaction Assistant** is a focused system that helps developers **respond to pull request reviewer feedback efficiently, safely, and with minimal cognitive overhead**.  
This system is not responsible for code review — it reacts to already-provided reviewer comments, determines which require action, and streamlines the entire response cycle.

---

## System Objective

- **Apply safe, low-effort reviewer suggestions** immediately (e.g., GitHub’s one-click fixes).
- **Defer, reject, or flag risky or ambiguous suggestions** to avoid derailing the development flow.
- **Request clarification** from reviewers when needed to convert vague input into committable actions.
- **Batch and prioritize** feedback based on effort, risk, and value.
- **Delegate responsibilities** across focused roles for modular, scalable development.

---

## Core Roles

### 1. Orchestrator Agent
- Manages the entire feedback-handling workflow.
- Delegates tasks to the appropriate agents (Interaction, Expert, etc.).
- Coordinates structured input/output between systems.
- Does not make judgment calls on content.

### 2. Interaction Agent
- Replies directly to reviewer comments.
- Requests clarification, concrete suggestions, or committable diffs.
- Ensures polite, efficient, and structured communication.

### 3. Domain Expert Agent
- Understands the context of the project.
- Determines which comments are safe to apply, risky, or ignorable.
- Provides approval logic or deferral strategy based on impact and cost.

### 4. Task Classifier
- Analyzes comments to assign:
  - Effort level (low/medium/high)
  - Risk (safe/uncertain/dangerous)
  - Type (style, logic, documentation, architecture)
- Labels feedback for batching and delegation.

### 5. Data Agent
- Retrieves pull request data via API (comments, suggestions, threads).
- Prepares structured datasets for other agents.
- Ensures clean separation between data extraction and response logic.

### 6. Researcher Agent (Optional)
- Investigates unclear technical references or external requirements.
- Assists Domain Expert by gathering reliable supporting context.

## Interaction Channels (Ranked by Effort)

| Channel                            | Description                                                | Effort     | Batching Potential |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------|
| GitHub Suggested Changes           | One-click UI for simple diffs                              | Very Low   | High              |
| Inline Reviewer Comments           | Prose suggestions attached to specific lines               | Low        | Medium            |
| Threaded Review Conversations      | General comments, questions, or broader design feedback    | Medium     | Low               |
| Copilot / AI Editor Suggestions    | Manual interactions with Copilot/LLMs based on comment     | Medium     | Medium            |
| External LLM Tools                 | Copy-paste into GPT, Claude, etc.                          | Variable   | Low               |

## Efficiency Principles

- **Favor low-risk, low-effort tasks** for immediate application.
- **Reject or defer any suggestion that introduces high complexity or risk**.
- **Clarify vague feedback before taking action** — never guess the reviewer’s intent.
- **Batch process simple review tasks** (with potential for cross-project batching in future iterations) to optimize attention.
- **Avoid over-processing** reviewer comments unless there’s meaningful benefit.

---

## Labeling & Task Delegation

- GitHub does not support labels on comments.  
  Instead:
  - Generate **issues** or **checklists** that group similar review feedback.
  - Apply labels like `routine`, `needs-clarification`, `risky`, `defer`, etc.
- Comments that cannot be resolved quickly are escalated to issues or assigned for later batching.

---

## Scope and Boundaries

- **This system handles reviewer interaction only**.  
  It does not perform code review, test generation, or documentation inference.
- Broader systems (e.g., project planning, time management, unified flow trackers) can **link to this system**, but remain separate.
- Each agent is independently composable and can be developed as a small module or microservice.

---

## Example Workflow

1. **Orchestrator** pulls review data and sends to the Classifier.
2. **Classifier** tags comments by type, effort, risk.
3. **Expert** approves or defers changes based on project understanding.
4. **Interaction Agent** requests clarifications if needed.
5. **Safe suggestions** are applied immediately (e.g., via GitHub UI).
6. **Unresolved items** are converted into tasks or GitHub issues with labels for tracking.

---

## Future Extensions

- Reviewer coaching: ask reviewers for more committable suggestions upfront.
- Confidence estimation for suggestions: "safe to auto-apply" score.
- UI dashboard for navigating comments by priority and risk.
- Integration with Copilot Workspace or similar for tighter editor feedback loops.
