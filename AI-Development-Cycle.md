# AI-Assisted Development Cycle (Solo Human + AI)

A structured workflow for efficiently planning, building, and refining systems using AI as a co-developer and thinking partner.

---

## Phase 1: Define the Objective
- **Goal:** Clarify what problem you're solving and what success looks like.
- **Inputs:** Desired outcome, pain points, constraints
- **AI Role:** Help scope, ask clarifying questions, suggest framing
- **Human Role:** Decide, validate assumptions
- **Output:** Problem statement, key goals

## Phase 2: Draft the System
- **Goal:** Design initial workflow or solution
- **AI Role:** Draft steps, suggest tools, provide examples
- **Human Role:** Review, approve, adapt
- **Output:** Initial draft of the workflow

## Phase 3: Plan Implementation
- **Goal:** Turn design into an actionable plan
- **AI Role:** Break down tasks, estimate time, suggest automation
- **Human Role:** Prioritize, choose tools
- **Output:** Action plan with tasks and timeline

## Phase 4: Execute in Loops
- **Goal:** Build and refine through iteration
- **Cycle:** AI drafts → Human reviews → AI refines
- **Optional:** AI writes tests, simulates edge cases
- **Output:** Working system or content

## Phase 5: Validate & QA
- **Goal:** Ensure functionality and safety
- **AI Role:** Suggest tests, check for gaps
- **Human Role:** Verify logic and real-world fit
- **Output:** Validated, ready-to-use system

## Phase 6: Document & Automate
- **Goal:** Capture knowledge and streamline repeatability
- **AI Role:** Draft docs, suggest automation
- **Human Role:** Approve, connect to team tools
- **Output:** Docs, SOPs, automated workflows
