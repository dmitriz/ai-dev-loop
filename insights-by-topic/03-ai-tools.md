# AI Tools & Collaboration

## Tool Evaluation Insights

- **Copilot limitations:** Approval required for command execution slows flow but provides a critical safety net. Still viable when tasks are kept small.
- **Exploring alternatives:** Tools like Cursor and Tabnine should only be pursued when a concrete productivity bottleneck is identified.
- **Perplexity as a tool:** Leveraging Perplexity's low-friction suggestion engine produced a high volume of useful, structured insights with minimal cognitive load.
- **API usability validation:** Time spent exploring broken/incomplete APIs highlighted the need to test basic API usability upfront—before committing deep resources.
- **Perplexity workflow advantages:**
  - The productivity process using Perplexity was found to be low-friction and high-yield, offering a suggestion-driven workflow.
  - The back-and-forth between chats was not only manageable but mentally refreshing—a useful cognitive switch between deep work and exploratory tasks.
  - The user experience can be further improved by exploring tablet split-screen or parallel app usage.
  - Perplexity's dynamic response generation and its "next question" suggestions offer a sustained feedback loop for idea expansion.

## Multi-Agent Collaboration

- **Agent networks:** The true productivity boost doesn't come from one AI model but from a network of them—specialized, modular, and collaborative.
- **Microservices architecture parallel:** Envision agent networks like services in a microservices architecture: each does one thing well and communicates with others.
- **Workflow orchestration:** The power of multi-agent collaboration increases when workflows are modular, predictable, and lightweight.
- **Systematic comparison:** Systematically compare insights from multiple models (e.g., Gemini, Claude, Perplexity).
- **Insight-curator agent concept:**
  - Introduce an agent called `insight-curator`:
    - Ingests raw feedback from any source
    - Extracts actionable insights
    - Tags for reuse
    - Flags for human review when:
      - Confidence score < 0.7
      - Contradicts existing insights
      - Contains novel strategic direction

## Human + AI Synergy

- **Cognitive division of labor:**
  - Use human cognition for pattern recognition, prioritization, and long-term strategy.
  - Use agents for parsing, logging, summarizing, and prompting next steps.
  - Long-term productivity increases when humans remove themselves from repeated low-value operations.
- **Interactive research automation:** The process demonstrated a form of interactive research automation, where idea generation is partially offloaded to a tool and used for inspiration, not decision-making.
- **Cognitive gear-shifting:** Alternating between focused coding work and AI browsing acted as a productive "gear change," preventing burnout and supporting creative thinking.
- **Context blending:** Leveraging features like split-screen on tablets turns "context switching" into "context blending."
- **Automation and human-in-the-loop design:**
  - Strike balance between automation and human oversight:
    - Let user confirm automation actions until trust is built.
    - Offer previews before committing changes.
  - Gradually escalate automation:
    1. Suggest next task
    2. Start timer automatically
    3. End session and push updates autonomously
  - Introduce fallback control: a panic command or override flag to halt automation instantly.

## AI Limitations and Workarounds

- **Context window limitations:**
  - Current LLMs are limited by context windows, but working toward:
    - Archive-as-memory: all past insights are always accessible
    - AI memory as hyperlinked markdown across repositories
  - Building toward:
    - A tree of `insight-chains`: ideas that evolved from each other
    - A search index powered by embeddings
    - Lightweight CLI tool to grep and preview any past insight with tags
- **Interpretability requirements:** Prioritize interpretable outputs: agents that explain what they're doing build trust and debuggability.
- **Feedback consolidation & cognitive relief:**
  - Consolidating feedback from multiple LLMs into one review session significantly reduces decision fatigue.
  - Batch responses: read 5–7 agent suggestions at once, then act on the aggregate.
  - Offer a "consensus summary" option where agents vote or rank each other's outputs.
  - Cluster insights: group by topic, intent (refactor, improve, challenge), or outcome (implement, reject, explore later).
