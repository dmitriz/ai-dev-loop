# Knowledge Management

## Information Archiving Strategies

- **Insight storage need:** A bottleneck was identified in managing long-term storage of useful insights, resulting in the creation of structured insight files.
- **Archiving principles:**
  - Every insight session should generate a persistent artifact (like a markdown file).
  - Structure insights into digestible parts (parts 1-N) to prevent truncation or overload.
  - Store in a version-controlled system (e.g., GitHub) for traceability, sharing, and automation.
- **Time investment tradeoffs:**
  - A few minutes spent now on structured archiving may save hours of repeated analysis later.
  - Long-term memory > short-term urgency in systems that accumulate insight over time.
  - Prioritize workflows that compound in value with minimal recurring cost.
- **Structural organization:**
  - Every useful idea deserves a "home." A good archive reduces mental load and increases system trust.
  - Long files should be broken into parts early, not only to prevent truncation but to preserve thematic clarity.
  - File naming matters: short, consistent, and descriptive naming (e.g., `insights-part-X`) enables faster access and indexing.

## Insight Storage and Retrieval

- **Proposed directory structure:**
  - `/insights`: distilled core ideas
  - `/feedback`: user or agent feedback
  - `/logs`: chronological transcripts
  - `/meta`: system design principles
- **Toward enhanced searchability:**
  - Building a tree of `insight-chains`: ideas that evolved from each other
  - A search index powered by embeddings
  - Lightweight CLI tool to grep and preview any past insight with tags
- **Archive protection strategy:**
  - Even if some insights are not immediately useful, the fact that they are captured means we protect against idea loss—a major productivity leak in high-velocity environments.
  - This justifies having an **archive mechanism** (like the `backlog/insights-*` folder) for deferred insights and knowledge.
  - Using tools like GitHub ensures the insights are versioned, accessible, and scalable—ready to be turned into future projects, features, or automations.

## Archive Intelligence

- **Active vs. passive archives:**
  - The archive isn't passive — it's the future brain. It must be structured to support:
    - Fast querying
    - Semantic linking
    - Automated refactoring
- **Insight curation:**
  - Introduce an agent called `insight-curator`:
    - Ingests raw feedback from any source
    - Extracts actionable insights
    - Tags for reuse
    - Flags for human review when:
      - Confidence score < 0.7
      - Contradicts existing insights
      - Contains novel strategic direction
- **Synthesis and meta-knowledge:**
  - Synthesizing and prioritizing insights later can be done using meta-agents or scripts that scan the archive for tags, clusters, or recurring themes.
  - The approach enables faster throughput of idea validation, systematization, and deferral for future batching—an essential practice for scaling mental work.

## Working Memory and Knowledge Fragmentation

- **Working memory bottlenecks:**
  - A major productivity bottleneck arises when short-term ideas aren't captured reliably.
  - Determining the point of diminishing returns is not just about the volume of insights, but also the cognitive cost vs. downstream impact. This varies across sessions.
  - The key metric might be: "Do these insights change today's execution?" If not, they can be archived, deferred, or compressed.
- **Flow between knowledge & action:**
  - Treat the insight archive as a launching pad for MVP decisions.
  - Keep a "reviewable backlog" of insights when prioritizing new features or iterations.
  - Don't let unstructured brilliance get lost—routine review builds strategic clarity.
- **Integration with development workflow:**
  - Operational bottlenecks can be reduced by:
    - Embedding a query like "have we already solved this?" into every coding loop
    - Linking code commits to insight IDs to track reasoning
  - Create internal protocols for summarizing and storing responses from AI assistants.
  - Treat external feedback as inputs into your insight archive, not just transient chat content.
