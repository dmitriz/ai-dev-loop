# 02 - MVP Planning & Development

## MVP Design Principles

- **MVP = problem-solution validation:** Focus is not on building a full product but validating the smallest unit of real value.
- **Value of seeing the loop complete:** Completing a tiny full cycle (idea → task → implementation → session → break → commit) is more useful than a partially complete system with more features.
- **Maximizing validated learning:** MVPs are not about the smallest product. They're about maximizing validated learning with minimal effort.
- **Hypothesis testing:** Each MVP should test a hypothesis:
  - "Will users find value in automation of task selection?"
  - "Will session enforcement improve deep work?"
- **Success metrics:** Track MVP success through behavioral signals: repeat usage, reduced friction, quicker decision-making.
- **Feature elimination:** A successful MVP eliminates the need to build unnecessary features, not just proves a concept.

## Feature Prioritization Frameworks

- **Feature creep defense:** All decisions run through frameworks like MoSCoW and "Impact vs. Effort" matrices.
- **Minimal Task Cycler MVP focus:** Focused on an `npm start` command that:
  - Picks next task
  - Starts/stops session timer
  - Enforces breaks
  - Reads/writes to local JSON files (tasks and state)
- **Diminishing returns awareness:**
  - Diminishing returns are not only about content redundancy—they are about rising management cost per insight.
  - When feedback becomes repetitive, or when new inputs no longer affect direction, that's a signal to pause.
  - Tracking marginal value per session is a way to gauge when to pivot toward action.
- **Key metric prioritization:** "Do these insights change today's execution?" If not, they can be archived, deferred, or compressed.

## Implementation Strategies

- **System-level productivity loop goal:** The ultimate objective is to build an automation-driven development ecosystem, where autonomous agents can:
  - Pick tasks
  - Execute them
  - Summarize outcomes
  - Self-improve
- **Automation and Human-in-the-Loop Design:**
  - Strike balance between automation and human oversight:
    - Let user confirm automation actions until trust is built.
    - Offer previews before committing changes.
  - Gradually escalate automation:
    1. Suggest next task
    2. Start timer automatically
    3. End session and push updates autonomously
  - Introduce fallback control: a panic command or override flag to halt automation instantly.
- **Agent networks as microservices:**
  - Envision agent networks like services in a microservices architecture: each does one thing well and communicates with others.
  - Agents should be designed around predictable inputs and outputs. This makes chaining easier and less fragile.
  - Statelessness improves modularity: agents that don't rely on deep memory can be more interchangeable.
  - Knowledge agents vs. execution agents: separate "researchers" from "builders" for clearer division of labor.

## Testing and Validation Approaches

- **Testing MVPs with real usage:** Every MVP should be a working loop—even if primitive—that enables real sessions and break enforcement.
- **API usability validation:** Time spent exploring broken/incomplete APIs highlighted the need to test basic API usability upfront—before committing deep resources.
- **Operational bottlenecks identification:**
  - Key bottlenecks identified:
    - Switching tools (manual effort)
    - Copilot fatigue (mental load)
    - Decision rework (not knowing if something was already done)
  - Solutions emerging:
    - Embed a query like "have we already solved this?" into every coding loop
    - Link code commits to insight IDs to track reasoning
