# Systems Architecture

## Systems Thinking Principles

- **System growth dynamics:**
  - The system must grow faster than the friction it creates.
  - Recording insights is one loop; synthesizing, indexing, and applying them is another. All loops need maintenance.
  - A healthy system converts inspiration into implementation through structured delegation.
- **Meta-productivity design insights:**
  - The ultimate objective is to build an automation-driven development ecosystem, where autonomous agents can:
    - Pick tasks
    - Execute them
    - Summarize outcomes
    - Self-improve
  - Completing a tiny full cycle (idea → task → implementation → session → break → commit) is more useful than a partially complete system with more features.
- **Implementation strategy:**
  - Minimal Task Cycler MVP: Focused on an `npm start` command that:
    - Picks next task
    - Starts/stops session timer
    - Enforces breaks
    - Reads/writes to local JSON files (tasks and state)
  - Testing MVPs with real usage: Every MVP should be a working loop—even if primitive—that enables real sessions and break enforcement.

## Agent Networks and Architecture

- **Network over isolation:**
  - The true productivity boost doesn't come from one AI model but from a network of them—specialized, modular, and collaborative.
  - Envision agent networks like services in a microservices architecture: each does one thing well and communicates with others.
- **Design principles:**
  - Agents should be designed around predictable inputs and outputs. This makes chaining easier and less fragile.
  - Statelessness improves modularity: agents that don't rely on deep memory can be more interchangeable.
  - Knowledge agents vs. execution agents: separate "researchers" from "builders" for clearer division of labor.
  - Prioritize interpretable outputs: agents that explain what they're doing build trust and debuggability.
- **Human + agent synergy:**
  - Use human cognition for pattern recognition, prioritization, and long-term strategy.
  - Use agents for parsing, logging, summarizing, and prompting next steps.
  - Long-term productivity increases when humans remove themselves from repeated low-value operations.
- **Insight curation architecture:**
  - Introduce an agent called `insight-curator`:
    - Ingests raw feedback from any source
    - Extracts actionable insights
    - Tags for reuse
    - Flags for human review when:
      - Confidence score < 0.7
      - Contradicts existing insights
      - Contains novel strategic direction

## Beyond Context Windows

- **Addressing LLM limitations:**
  - Current LLMs are limited by context windows, but working toward:
    - Archive-as-memory: all past insights are always accessible
    - AI memory as hyperlinked markdown across repositories
- **Knowledge structure:**
  - Build a tree of `insight-chains`: ideas that evolved from each other
  - A search index powered by embeddings
  - Lightweight CLI tool to grep and preview any past insight with tags
- **Archive intelligence strategy:**
  - The archive isn't passive — it's the future brain. It must be structured to support:
    - Fast querying
    - Semantic linking
    - Automated refactoring
  - Proposed directory split:
    - `/insights`: distilled core ideas
    - `/feedback`: user or agent feedback
    - `/logs`: chronological transcripts
    - `/meta`: system design principles

## Operational Bottlenecks and Solutions

- **Identified bottlenecks:**
  - Switching tools (manual effort)
  - Copilot fatigue (mental load)
  - Decision rework (not knowing if something was already done)
- **Emerging solutions:**
  - Embed a query like "have we already solved this?" into every coding loop
  - Link code commits to insight IDs to track reasoning
- **Automation and human-in-the-loop design:**
  - Strike balance between automation and human oversight:
    - Let user confirm automation actions until trust is built.
    - Offer previews before committing changes.
  - Gradually escalate automation:
    1. Suggest next task
    2. Start timer automatically
    3. End session and push updates autonomously
  - Introduce fallback control: a panic command or override flag to halt automation instantly.
- **Reducing friction in repetitive tasks:**
  - Identify repetitive decisions: starting/stopping sessions, selecting tasks, writing commit messages.
  - Create protocols for summarizing and storing responses from AI assistants.
  - Systematically compare insights from multiple models (e.g., Gemini, Claude, Perplexity).
