- **API Key:** Not required (unless Enterprise BYOLLM).
- **Autonomy:** Agent Mode allows regex-based allow/deny for AI-initiated commands only, *not* for user-typed commands. No autonomous code execution for user or external agents.
- **Block UX:** Commands and outputs grouped as blocks. No documented inline collapsibility or direct inline annotation in history (annotations are via Notebooks/Workflows).

### 1.2 Amazon Q for Command Line

- **Features:** AI ghost-text suggestions, natural language (# prefix or `q translate`), strong AWS CLI support.
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **Pricing:** Free (unlimited completions, 50 chat/mo), Pro $19/mo (unlimited chat).
- **API Key:** No (uses AWS authentication).
- **Autonomy:** No autonomous execution; all commands require user confirmation.

### 1.3 Wave Terminal

- **Features:** Open source, supports AI chat via multiple providers (OpenAI, Claude, local Ollama, etc.), blocks as UI panes (not command-output blocks).
- **Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **Pricing:** Free (Apache 2.0), requires user’s own API keys for LLMs or uses local models.
- **Autonomy:** No; always prompts before running commands/scripts.

### 1.4 GitHub Copilot in the CLI

- **Features:** Natural language command suggestion via `gh copilot suggest`; interactive, not ghost-text.
- **Platforms:** Any (via GitHub CLI).
- **Pricing:** Paid (included in Copilot Pro, $10/mo).
- **API Key:** No (uses GitHub auth).
- **Autonomy:** No; all commands are suggested for user review and approval.

### 1.5 Cline

- **Platforms:** Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **Pricing:** Free and Pro (starts $20/mo).
- **API Key:** Uses own quota, can BYO OpenAI key.
- **Autonomy:** Always prompts for code actions, never autonomous execution.
- **Notes:** Best-in-class code AI, but **not a terminal**; pairs well with terminal AI tools.

### 1.9 Windsurf

- **Features:** AI-native IDE/terminal; supports agent workflows, prompt engineering, natural language to code/shell, code review, session sharing, and plugin ecosystem.
- **Platforms:** Web (browser-based), cross-platform desktop (in development).
- **Pricing:** Freemium (free, Pro/Team plans).
- **API Key:** No key required for basic features, can integrate BYO for custom agents.
- **Autonomy:** Session agent can be partially autonomous (configurable per agent/workflow), with manual or auto-approve flows.
- **Notes:** Advanced AI workflow automation, best for prompt engineering, team coding, and integrated review/QA.

### 1.10 Trae

- **Features:** AI workflow and automation tool for devs; natural language to code/shell, automation recipes, batch agent workflows.
- **Platforms:** Web-based, desktop agent (beta).
- **Pricing:** Free trial, paid plans in roadmap.
- **Autonomy:** Can run in full autonomous mode (`--yes` or "autopilot")—executes any LLM command without prompting.
  WARNING: Enabling full autonomy may introduce significant security risks; use only in secure, isolated environments.
- **Autonomy:** Manual approval by default; supports batch/recipe flows with partial autonomy.
- **Notes:** Early-stage, focused on automating repetitive dev tasks and scripts.

## 2. AI Coding Agents with Shell Access

### 2.1 Open Interpreter

- **Features:** General-purpose AI agent; can run shell commands, scripts, code.
- **Autonomy:** Can run in full autonomous mode (`--yes` or "autopilot")—executes any LLM command w/o prompting.
- **Matching:** No filtering by default—runs any output from the model.
- **Replacement for Cursor?** Yes for autonomous AI code/test/fix, but not an IDE; lacks in-editor UX.

### 2.2 Aider

- **Features:** AI coding assistant for codebases; integrates with Git, can modify and commit code.
- **Autonomy:** Configurable. Can auto-run trusted commands (e.g., all git ops) if enabled, otherwise asks for approval.
- **Matching:** Trust by type/category, not regex or folder. No fine-grained or folder-based boundaries.
- **Replacement for Cursor?** Yes for automated code fixing, but less IDE integration.

### 2.3 Custom LangChain, CrewAI, Auto-GPT Agents

| Block Collapsibility        | No                      | Yes                   | No                     | No                   |

- **Features:** Fully programmable agent frameworks.
- **Autonomy:** Can be set to full autonomy; you define the approval policy.
- **Matching:** Unlimited flexibility; allow/deny lists or pattern boundaries possible, but require coding.
- **Replacement for Cursor?** Possible if you build required logic.

## 3. Block-Based UX: Collapsibility and Annotation

| Feature      | Warp Terminal         | Ttyphoon (alpha)      | Windows Terminal        | Kitty Terminal        |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Block Grouping (Cmd+Output) | Yes  | Yes                  | Yes (shell integration) | Yes (shell integration) |
| Block Collapsibility        | Not documented          | Yes                   | No                     | No                   |

- **IDE/Editor Integration:** Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, Windsurf do not allow autonomous execution; always require user approval.

**Key Gaps:**  
No terminal currently provides both inline collapsibility and direct user annotation on command/output blocks in the main session view (Warp has Notebooks/Workflows for structured notes).

---

## 4. Trust, Boundaries, and API Policies

- **Autonomous Execution:** Only Open Interpreter and Aider (with config) support full autonomy for running AI-generated commands/scripts.
- **Allow/Deny Patterns:** Only Warp Agent Mode supports regex allow/deny for *agent* commands, not for arbitrary user or external agent commands.
- **Fine-grained Boundaries:** No agent provides out-of-the-box per-folder or per-repository execution boundaries; must be coded in agent frameworks.
- **API Keys:** Warp/CoPilot do *not* require manual API keys; Wave, Cline, Roo, Trae, Aider do (or can use local models).
- **IDE/Editor Integration:** Cursor, Copilot, Claude Code, Cody/Windsurf do not allow autonomous execution; always require user approval.

### Last updated: May 2024

- **Best for Autonomous AI Coding/Execution:** Open Interpreter (max autonomy), Aider (code-focused, some limits).
- **Best for Safe, Regex-Pattern Control:** Warp Terminal Agent Mode (but only for its internal AI agent, not user input or external LLMs).
- **Best for Privacy and Local Models:** Wave Terminal, Cline, Roo, Trae (open source, supports local Ollama LLMs).
- **Best for Structured Documentation:** Warp Terminal + Notebooks/Workflows.
- **Best for Inline Ghost-Text AI Completion:** Warp Terminal, Amazon Q for Command Line (with more generous free tier).
- **Best for Code-First AI/IDE Experience:** Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot (but these do *not* run code autonomously).

---

**Note:** No tool today fully combines IDE/editor integration, true autonomous execution, block-based collapsibility, inline annotation, and fine-grained boundaries out of the box.
