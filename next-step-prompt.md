# Next Development Step

Based on your current understanding of the project, what is the most logical next step in its development?

Provide the code for this step. Ensure the code:

- Follows correct programming style.
- Is free from errors (including syntax errors or markdown formatting issues if your response includes markdown).

If you lack sufficient information to proceed confidently, please ask for specific details.

After generating the initial code:

1. Simulate its execution.
2. Thoroughly analyze the hypothetical output and any relevant test results.
3. Identify areas for self-improvement regarding the code's functionality, efficiency, or style.
4. Revise the code to incorporate these improvements, ensuring the final version is correct and error-free.
