# Automation Problems

This document captures a comprehensive, structured list of real-world automation problems identified by the author. Each problem is framed with its context, pain points, and any known constraints. No solutions are included in this file—this is a source of truth for the problem space alone.

## Problem: AI-Generated Tests Are Behaviorally Weak

- **Issue**: Copilot and other models generate test cases that often:
  - Repeat implementation logic
  - Make trivial or irrelevant assertions
  - Fail to cover real behavioral paths
- **Impact**: Low-quality test coverage, false confidence, noise in CI/CD pipelines
- **Need**: Validation and structured review of test semantics

---

## Problem: AI Tools Forget Prior Prompts and Completions

- **Issue**: AI sessions are stateless across time; past prompts and responses are not remembered, categorized, or reused
- **Impact**: Repetition of work, inconsistent behavior, lost insights
- **Need**: Structured memory system across tools and agents

---

## Problem: Inline AI Interaction Is Opaque and Non-Reproducible

- **Issue**: Prompts and completions inside chat interfaces are not traceable or version-controlled
- **Impact**: Impossible to audit, repeat, or debug AI decisions
- **Need**: Mechanisms for tracing, versioning, and reproducing AI interactions

---

## Problem: Unscoped Agent Execution Can Corrupt Data or Leak Secrets

- **Issue**: Agents operate on full workspace or external systems without isolation
- **Impact**: Risk of unintended changes, data exposure, or logic errors
- **Need**: Robust isolation mechanisms and configurable permission models for agent execution to prevent unintended side-effects

---

## Problem: Cross-Repository Dependencies Are Hard to Synchronize

- **Issue**: Multiple repositories depend on shared modules or config versions, but are updated independently
- **Impact**: Version drift, CI failures, inconsistent environments
- **Need**: Automation for tag propagation, config sync, and cross-repo orchestration

---

## Problem: GitHub PR Feedback Is Unstructured and Easily Lost

- **Issue**: Reviewer comments live in threads, with no summary or priority structure
- **Impact**: Hard to act on feedback, prone to oversight
- **Need**: Feedback extraction, classification, and integration into test and code review flows

---

## Problem: Feedback to AI Agents Is Not Audited or Validated

- **Issue**: Agents receive raw outputs from LLMs without validation or second-level checks
- **Impact**: Faulty code, missed edge cases, non-reproducible suggestions
- **Need**: Secondary review pipeline before outputs are accepted

---

## Problem: Repetitive Prompting Wastes Time and Effort

- **Issue**: Lack of prompt reuse leads to asking the same questions repeatedly across sessions and tools
- **Impact**: Developer fatigue, inefficiency, loss of accumulated knowledge
- **Need**: Indexed prompt library, searchable by topic and context

---

## Problem: Test Intent Is Not Aligned with Code or Docs

- **Issue**: Tests may be present but do not reflect the actual documented or expected behavior
- **Impact**: Gaps in quality, misleading test coverage
- **Need**: Behavior–doc–test alignment validation

---

## Problem: Secrets Are Exposed Through Common ENV Patterns

- **Issue**: Environment variables are often used for secrets, leading to leakage via logs, subprocesses, or memory
- **Impact**: Security risk including unauthorized system access, potential data breaches, and compliance violations
- **Need**: Container-internal, non-host-mounted secrets directory

---

## Problem: Project Knowledge Is Scattered Across Repositories

- **Issue**: Architecture, design, test, and prompt documentation is split across multiple repos with no semantic index
- **Impact**: Difficult discovery, duplication, loss of cross-project insight
- **Need**: Cross-repo knowledge discovery and semantic search

---

## Problem: AI Feedback Is Often Vague or Misaligned

- **Issue**: LLMs may generate feedback that lacks specificity, relevance, or actionable value
- **Impact**: Wasted cycles, misguidance, noise in iteration
- **Need**: Feedback scoring and filtering before it reaches agent loop or developer
