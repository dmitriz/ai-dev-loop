# Insights – Part 9

## On Tradeoffs Between Immediate Delivery and Long-Term Efficiency

- Not all MVP work should be rushed—investing time now to prevent long-term waste can be justified.
- Evaluate “cuts” based not only on speed—but also on how they affect future development velocity.
- Strategic delay (e.g., to archive insights, test tooling) can improve system throughput long-term.

## On Side Sessions and Cognitive Relief

- Interleaving focused coding with exploratory activities (like AI querying) can refresh mental energy.
- Structured “side loops” (e.g., feedback harvesting with Perplexity) can be productive breaks, not distractions.
- The trick is to contain them with clear boundaries: defining when to start, what to capture, how to archive collected insights, and determining when to stop.

## On Session Layering and Mental Context Switching

- Use mobile features like split-screen to reduce friction between parallel task threads.
- Context switching is less harmful when the task types are cognitively distinct (e.g., typing vs. reading).
- Efficiency comes from minimizing re-orientation time, not necessarily doing one thing only.

## On High-Frequency Capture and Loop Design

- Frequent insight capture should not require task switching—it should be as easy as typing into a notepad.
- Offload storage and tagging from the brain to the system.
- Keep the feedback → insight → implementation → outcome loop tight and traceable.

## Suggested Practices

- Introduce a “daily dropbox” file for raw insights, cleaned and sorted weekly.
- Tag and link insights to related backlog items or MVPs.
- Use scripts or AI to propose next actions from insights (auto-summarization, label suggestion).

# Insights – Part 10

## On Strategic Layering of Knowledge and Execution

- Not all insights need immediate execution—store, tag, and revisit when relevant.
- Create a clear divide between “execution backlog” and “insight archive.”
- Long-term systems thinking is a valid investment, especially when paired with automation.

## On Tools that Accelerate Throughput

- Favor tools with a low activation cost—fast start, minimal overhead, responsive feedback.
- Perplexity’s low-effort, high-yield model offers compounding returns when paired with your workflow.
- AI tools should feel like collaborators, not interfaces. Look for ones that reduce your cognitive burden.

## On Breaking the Ceiling of Manual Capacity

- Manual workflows don’t scale well—your agent network should gradually assume:
  - Insight extraction
  - Task prioritization
  - Delegation
  - Retrospective analysis
- The human role becomes more supervisory: reviewing, nudging, re-aligning.

## On Designing Agent Ecosystems

- Feedback agents should cross-validate and challenge each other.
- Learning loops between agents (e.g., critique + correction + re-test) are vital for compound productivity.
- Future: agents form autonomous project loops with minimal human prompting.

## On Naming and Structure

- Use a short, consistent naming convention (e.g., `insights-part-X.md`) to avoid truncation and ambiguity.
- Use the folder name (`backlog`) as the context wrapper—file names don’t need to repeat that.
