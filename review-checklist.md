# Pull Request Review Checklist

## 1. Prioritization
- [ ] Only review pull requests that are essential.
- [ ] Skip cosmetic or minor improvements unless they block progress.

## 2. Review Path
- [ ] Start with GitHub online review.
- [ ] Then open VS Code and sync with the latest branch changes.

## 3. In VS Code
- [ ] Quickly go through remaining comments.
- [ ] Use Copilot for changes unless a specific suggestion is provided.
- [ ] Decide if each suggestion is essential. Skip non-essential.
- [ ] If essential, commit before or after applying the suggestion.
- [ ] Avoid long Copilot sessions. If it takes too long, skip or revert.

## 4. Finalization
- [ ] Once all review comments are addressed, commit and push.
- [ ] Merge pull request locally (preferred), or on GitHub if needed.
- [ ] Delete branch locally and remotely after merge.

## Notes
- Keep review sessions short and focused.
- Always prefer minimal clean merges over perfect but delayed changes.
