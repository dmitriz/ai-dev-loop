# Insights – Parts 20 to 27

---

## Part 20: Archive Intelligence Strategy

- The archive isn’t passive — it’s the future brain. It must be structured to support:
  - Fast querying
  - Semantic linking
  - Automated refactoring

- Proposed directory split:
  - `/insights`: distilled core ideas
  - `/feedback`: user or agent feedback
  - `/logs`: chronological transcripts
  - `/meta`: system design principles

- Introduce an agent called `insight-curator`:
  - Ingests raw feedback from any source
  - Extracts actionable insights
  - Tags for reuse
  - Flags for human review only if unclear

---

## Part 21: Beyond Context Windows

- Current LLMs are limited by context windows, but you’re working toward:
  - Archive-as-memory: all past insights are always accessible
  - AI memory as hyperlinked markdown across your repos

- You’ll build:
  - A tree of `insight-chains`: ideas that evolved from each other
  - A search index powered by embeddings
  - Lightweight CLI tool to grep and preview any past insight with tags

---

## Part 22: Operational Bottlenecks and Relief Patterns

- Key bottlenecks identified:
  - Switching tools (manual effort)
  - Copilot fatigue (mental load)
  - Decision rework (not knowing if something was already done)

- Solutions emerging:
  - Embed a query like “have we already solved this?” into every coding loop
  - Link code commits to insight IDs to track reasoning
  - Use CLI to call AI from any repo or file

---

## Part 23: Evolution of the Loop

- The productivity loop is becoming:
  - Self-curating (archiving insights on the fly)
  - Self-directing (proposing what’s next)
  - Self-assessing (summarizing effectiveness)

- Future upgrade:
  - The loop becomes a *meta-agent* that manages its own sub-agents
  - Prompt: “Delegate insight logging for today to the assistant”
  - Result: Background agents handle everything unless critical input needed

---

## Part 24: MVP as Experiment, Not Product

- Reminder: MVP is not a product, it’s a **probe**.
  - Probe into user behavior
  - Probe into system bottlenecks
  - Probe into AI-human collaboration

- Build probes fast:
  - Scripted backend
  - Dummy UI if needed
  - Manual triggers if automation not ready

- Log every result as insight, whether success or not

---

## Part 25: Structured Insight Compression

- Eventually, insights will be auto-compressed into formats like:
  - `IF context → THEN insight`
  - `Problem / Signal / Hypothesis / Test / Outcome`

- This format enables:
  - Easier reuse across agents
  - Training of new LLM agents
  - Filtering by structure (e.g., only show proven outcomes)

---

## Part 26: Long-Term Vision Triggers

- The trigger condition for evolving to full autonomy:
  - When >80% of tasks are self-initiated by agents
  - When code generation accuracy >90% without human edits
  - When agents critique and debug each other successfully
  - With mandatory safety guardrails:
    - Human review of all strategic decisions
    - Transparent audit logs of agent reasoning
    - Emergency override capabilities

- At that point, the loop moves to “maintenance mode” — only critical interventions by human

---

## Part 27: Compression and Execution Layer

- Once insights are compressed:
  - You can trigger “burst mode” — convert 10–20 insights into PRs or testable scripts
  - Use batch commands: `!execute-insights --from backlog/insights-part-23.md`

- AI becomes:
  - Compiler of thought
  - Executor of loops
  - Feedback mechanism for its own improvement
