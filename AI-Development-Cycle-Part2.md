# AI-Assisted Development Cycle (Part 2)

_Additional notes and best practices._

## Best Practices

- **Start Small**: Begin with well-defined, manageable objectives
- **Maintain Control**: AI suggests, human decides
- **Iterative Refinement**: Expect multiple loops of feedback and improvement
- **Documentation First**: Document decisions and rationale as you go

This completes the AI-assisted development cycle framework for solo builders working with an AI assistant.

_Use this as a repeatable template for fast, focused system-building._
